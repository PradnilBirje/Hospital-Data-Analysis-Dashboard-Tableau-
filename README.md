```# 📊 Hospital Data Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)
### 📌 Overview
In this project, I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze hospital data and extract meaningful insights about patient demographics, encounter types, healthcare costs, and mortality rates. The goal was to leverage data visualization to help healthcare providers make data-driven decisions that improve operational efficiency and patient care.

🎯 Why I Chose This Project
Healthcare is a data-rich industry, but raw data alone doesn’t drive insights. Visualizing hospital data helps in:
✅ Understanding patient demographics and health trends
✅ Analyzing hospital encounters and cost structures
✅ Identifying patterns in disease prevalence
✅ Evaluating mortality rates across different groups

With the rise of data-driven decision-making in healthcare, this project highlights how analytics can optimize hospital management and improve patient outcomes.

📊 Data Versatility & Complexity
The dataset consists of multiple tables, making it an excellent case for data blending and relationship modeling in Tableau. Key tables include:

Patients 🏥 (Demographic details, age, gender, location)
Encounters 📅 (Hospital visits, types of encounters, costs)
Procedures 💉 (Medical procedures performed)
Payers 💳 (Insurance and billing details)
Handling this diverse dataset required cleaning, joining, and transforming data to create a structured, analysis-ready format.

🔍 Data Analysis & Insights
I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in hospital operations:

✅ Page 1 – Patient & Encounter Overview
📌 Patients by Encounter Type – Identifies the most common hospital visit reasons
📌 Patients by Disease Count – Highlights prevalent health conditions
📌 Cost Claim by Encounter Type – Shows cost distribution across different encounter categories
📌 Average Base Encounter Cost by Class – Helps in hospital resource planning

✅ Page 2 – Geographic Patient Distribution
📌 Patients by Race, Country, and City – Identifies regional healthcare access gaps

✅ Page 3 – Demographic Analysis
📌 Age & Gender Distribution – Provides insights into patient profiles and age-related illnesses
📌 Age Category vs. Gender – Helps in targeted medical interventions

✅ Page 4 – Mortality & Risk Analysis
📌 Deceased Patients & Death Ratio – Analyzes hospital mortality trends
📌 Mortality by Country – Identifies geographic variations in healthcare outcomes
📌 Age-wise & Year-wise Death Trends – Helps hospitals predict and address at-risk populations

🎨 Visualization & Tableau Skills Demonstrated
✅ Calculated Fields – Used for custom metrics like age calculation and death ratio
✅ Filters & Parameters – Enabled interactive user experience
✅ Dual-axis & Combined Charts – Created visually rich insights
✅ Data Blending & Relationships – Integrated multiple tables effectively
✅ Dashboards & Storytelling – Transformed raw data into a compelling narrative

📈 Key Insights from the Dashboard
🔹 Certain age groups & genders are more prone to specific diseases
🔹 Costly encounter types require better resource allocation
🔹 Some regions have higher mortality rates, indicating healthcare gaps
🔹 Seasonal & year-wise trends show disease prevalence over time

🛠 Technologies Used
Tableau – Data visualization & dashboard design
Data Blending & Joins – Combining multiple hospital datasets```
